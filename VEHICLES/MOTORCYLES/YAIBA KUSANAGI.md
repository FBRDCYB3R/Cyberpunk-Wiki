VEHICLE DESCRIPTION:
The Yaiba Kusanagi CT-3X is the fastest, and unsurprisingly, the most expensive motorcycle, originally built in collaboration with the Arasaka Corporation. Its sleek, aerodynamic frame conceals a wickedly powerful engine. Ideally, anyone riding should be chipped with reflex boosters to avoid flying into a traffic light at 100 MPH when making a sharp turn. The Kusanagi is a favorite among gangers, especially the Tyger Claws.
