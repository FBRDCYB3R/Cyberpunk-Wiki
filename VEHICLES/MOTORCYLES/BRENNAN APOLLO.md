VEHICLE DESCRIPTION:
The Brennan Apollo doesn’t have the most elegant design, nor does it have the sleekest metal finish or the schmanciest dashboard gauges. But who cares? Only stuck-up city folk care about that sort of frippery, and the Apollo wasn’t made for them – it was made for the desert. Its oversized fuel tank allows it to complete long distances without refueling, while its solid build and suspension can easily withstand bumpy and rocky terrain – not to mention a powerful engine that will outrun any Raffen Shiv convoy.
