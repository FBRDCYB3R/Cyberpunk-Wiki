VEHICLE DESCRIPTION:
You don’t ride in a Villefort Alvarado, you cruise in one. This boot of a car boasts an engine worthy of the street’s respect. Despite its huge dimensions, however, the Alvarado handles well due to the double axles in the front. Unfortunately, this innovative design is still fairly unreliable and requires frequent, sometimes expensive, maintenance. For many in Night City’s underworld, the Alvarado serves as the ideal display of flashy luxury. The wide, syn-leather-upholstered seats also make cruising the city streets all the more enjoyable.
