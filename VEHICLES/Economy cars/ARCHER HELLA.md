HOW TO GET THE ARCHER HELLA EC-D I360 IN CYBERPUNK 2077:
The Archer Hella EC-D I360 in Cyberpunk 2077 is V's first car, given automatically to the player for free after the Prologue of the game.

At the start of Act 2, you'll lose your car due to an accident. You will have to wait for the car to be repaired in the Human Nature quest.

VEHICLE DESCRIPTION:
Cars should be made well… but never too well. Archer’s board of directors learned this truth the hard way when, in 2023, they launched the first Hella series which proved so reliable and easy to repair that it nearly drove the company to bankruptcy. Many who bought a Hella in those days – for a generously affordable price, it’s worth noting – often never found themselves on the car market again.

Even today, more than fifty years later, Archer Hellas are a fairly common sight on the streets of Night City. Of course, time has taken its toll, leaving many of them rusted and screechy. Still, they continue to move people from A to B; that is unless they crash into something along the way. In those cases, there isn’t much left to rescue from the wreckage. Despite their functional reliability, the car body is manufactured from cheap, brittle materials. Fortunately for most car owners, if you lose a bumper and a leg in an accident, both are easily replaceable.
