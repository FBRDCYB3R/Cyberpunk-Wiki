HOW TO GET THE THORTON GALENA GA40XT "RATTLER" IN CYBERPUNK 2077:
The Thorton Galena GA40XT "Rattler" in Cyberpunk 2077 is given as a free Reward after the Side Job mission "These Boots Are Made for Walkin" (Nomad Lifepath Only).

VEHICLE DESCRIPTION:
The fact this car still drives is a miracle. After years off-roading it in the desert, just about everything on this rig either creaks or grinds. The parts this car rolled off the assembly line with have been replaced by scrap metal and worn rubber.

The engineâ€™s constant wheezing has you convinced the car contracted terminal tuberculosis. If this scrap heap on wheels rolled into any city shop, the mechanic would probably vomit and faint. In short, only someone truly desperate would ever catch themselves sitting behind the wheel of this mobile tetanus trap.
