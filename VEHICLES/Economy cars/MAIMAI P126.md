VEHICLE DESCRIPTION:
The perfect car for anyone on a tight budget. The Makigai MaiMai is the cheapest mass-produced car available in Night City. All design decisions were made with one thing in mind: cut costs! Size? As small as possible while still fitting two (slender) people and (at most) one shopping bag. Engine? Probably stolen from a lawnmower. Materials? Plastic as durable as a disposable fork. Safety test ratings? Scraping by to keep street-legal status. All tied together into an easily affordable package. And they say corporations don’t look out for consumers’ best interests anymore…
