The Thorton Mackinaw "WarHorse" is a Economy vehicle featured in Cyberpunk 2077.

It’s no easy task surviving in the Badlands. Not unless you’re sitting behind the wheel of a rig like the Warhorse. Who’d believe this automotive marvel was built on the frame of simple Thorton Mackinaw? Standard body panels replaced with think armor plates, the base engine swapped for a fire-breathing monster and a cannon bolted to the top that even a tank pilot would be proud of. The roar of this beast carries far, causing a cold sweat to run down the back of any Wraith who hears it.
