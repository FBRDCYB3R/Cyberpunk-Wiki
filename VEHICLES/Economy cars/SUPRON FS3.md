VEHICLE DESCRIPTION:
Everyone wants a Rayfield or a Herrero, but not everyone can afford it. It’s with those customers in mind- the ones with big needs and limited means – that the Mahir Supron FS3 was built, its biggest selling point? If you hadn’t guessed from its look, sound, or feel – it’s cheap borscht. The Mahir Supron was constructed from cheap plastic, textiles, and wishful thinking. It breaks down often, but on the flip side it’s easy to fix. Its large size suggests it can carry a heavy load, but it’s not better not to get “carried” away – the anemic engine under the hood might just give up on you.
