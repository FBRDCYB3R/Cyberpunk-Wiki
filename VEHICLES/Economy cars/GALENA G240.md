VEHICLE DESCRIPTION:
It used to be people only desired bread and circuses. By the 21st century, however, automobiles were added to the list. Without a car, you can’t get to work, drop the kids at kindergarten, or escape spontaneous turf wars.

The Thorton Galena first hit roads in 2031 following a government stimulus to pump out affordable cars and give Americans a boost following the recession. As Thorton didn’t have much experience producing small cars at the time, the company bought engines for the Galena from India’s Mahir Motors. Unfortunately, the collaboration was not considered a success, with the Galena yielding unremarkable performance and even less remarkable sales. Still, it drives – and that’s the most important thing.
