The Rayfield Excalibur is a Hypercar AV (Aerial Vehicle) vehicle featured in Cyberpunk 2077.

HOW TO GET THE RAYFIELD EXCALIBUR IN CYBERPUNK 2077:
The Rayfield Excalibur is an uncontrollable vehicle in Cyberpunk 2077.

This AV appears in various missions, including The Corporate Prologue, and "The Heist" Quest where you can get the Satori Iconic Weapon.

However, as an Aerial Vehicle, it cannot be directly controlled by the player.

VEHICLE DESCRIPTION:
Rayfield is renowned in the world for its exclusive luxury limousines: the Caliburn and the Aerondight. But even expensive cars suffer from the same age-old problem as any other on the road: they can get caught in traffic. Sure, you could ask your security detail to empty a clip at the drivers ahead, subtly urging them to kindly get out of your way; however, most Rayfield owners prefer to avoid behavior as unrefined and inelegant as this.

To avoid the burden of traffic altogether for its loyal consumers, Rayfield engineered the Excalibur, a luxury AV that allows you to arrive everywhere punctually, safely, and, most importantly, in maximum comfort and style. That is, assuming your bank account is as close to bottomless as possible.
