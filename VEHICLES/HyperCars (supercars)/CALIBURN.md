VEHICLE DESCRIPTION:
The rich can be capricious. The dignified design of Rayfield’s flagship vehicle, the Aerondight, doesn’t appeal to everyone. Some prefer an equal level of luxury but with feistier flair.

Rayfield developed the Caliburn with these clients in mind. Imbued with a sportier soul and crafted with a fire-breathing engine and aerodynamic body, driving the Caliburn feels like flying a jet at ground level.

And whenever the driver wants to come down from their adrenaline high, they need only let go of the steering wheel to let the onboard navigational computer take control.
