VEHICLE DESCRIPTION:
It has been described that "probably less than a thousand people in the world can afford the Aerondight". Not your typical urban vehicle.

For many, the name Rayfield is synonymous with wealth – and for good reason. The price of the Rayfield Aerondight exceeds the GDP of many island nations. And it’s worth noting this British-made ultra-luxury, ultra-performance masterpiece is worth every penny of it.

The pedigree engine under its hood puts this car on equal footing with professional racing vehicles, and the interior feels like a 5-star penthouse suite. But if that’s not enough to get you excited, the Aerodight doesn’t have a single window.

With the help of a CrystalDome, the vehicle’s surroundings are displayed in real-time inside the cabin, ensuring complete driver privacy and stunning appearance.
