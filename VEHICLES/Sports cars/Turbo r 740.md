VEHICLE DESCRIPTION:
The Quadra Turbo-R was introduced as America's response to the Mizutani Japanase manufacturer of Sports Cars. It has a powerful turbo-charged V8 engine, but it was criticized for its suspension. It's the predecessor of the Quadra Turbo-R V-Tech.

At the beginning of the 21st century, American cities were flooded with Japanese sports cars: reliable, fast, affordable. But the release of the Quadra Turbo-R proved that the decline of the American automotive industry had been greatly exaggerated.

The Turbo-R instantly became a classic of its type, a dream on four wheels. It stole the hearts of car lovers everywhere with its powerful engine, responsive handling, and badass vibes. But there was a downside: the Turbo-R rode like a wild stallion, ready to buck unskilled drivers right out of the saddle. Only a real carjock could untap its potential. Amateur adrenaline junkies typically wound up losing control, hurting both themselves and their shiny, new Quadra.
