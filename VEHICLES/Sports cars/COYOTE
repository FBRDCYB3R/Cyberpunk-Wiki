VEHICLE DESCRIPTION:
By looking at it, you’d think the Mizutani Shion was a city car, built for thin-crust roads and unsuited for the desert wasteland. And you’d be right – the standard edition would grind to a dead halt at the first rocky knoll. But with upgrades, reinforcement, and improved suspension, the Shion cuts through harsh terrain like a laser knife through butter.
