VEHICLE DESCRIPTION:
What’s the difference between the V-Tech and the classic Turbo-R? Well… What’s the difference between a diamond and a chunk of coal? The building blocks are the same, but end results couldn’t be more different. Quadra’s Turbo-R V-Tech is the queen of the road, a car that turns heads even when you’re not burning rubber.

Another version was produced in 2069, but it never managed to surpass the legendary V-Tech in the eyes of drivers.
