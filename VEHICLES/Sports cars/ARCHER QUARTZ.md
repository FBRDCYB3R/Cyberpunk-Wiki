VEHICLE DESCRIPTION:
After Archer released the Hella, the company ran into trouble. The popular family car proved to be so reliable and affordable that it quickly saturated the market. To avoid self-cannibalization, Archer was forced to diversify its portfolio by expanding into the sports car sector. The fruit of their efforts finally emerged in 2041 with the Quartz.

This two-seater with a durable engine was marked at an approachable price, but the subtle elegance and sturdiness of its design make it popular among more than the urban middle class. The Quartz is, as it turns out, well suited to endure the harsh desert climate. As a result, it has become a mainstay vehicle for a large portion of the nomad population. Any city folk who have dared risk interstate ground transport can likely testify that the silhouette of a Quartz on the horizon spells fast-approaching trouble.
