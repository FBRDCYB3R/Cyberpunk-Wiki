VEHICLE DESCRIPTION:
The Quadra Type-66 is faster than a bat out of hell. Breaking news? Hardly. Originally released in 2055, the Quadra was quickly adopted by edgerunners and illegal street racers. For the NCPD, a Quadra tearing up the streets means a long list of traffic violations, but rarely has a patrol car ever managed – or even tried – to pull one over.
